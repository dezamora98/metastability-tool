TIMING-23#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between mt_hard_bd_i/Circuito_para_pruebas_v1_0_0/U0/Logica_usuario/Contador_tiempo/en_contador_tiempo_reg_i_1/I4 and mt_hard_bd_i/Circuito_para_pruebas_v1_0_0/U0/Logica_usuario/Contador_tiempo/en_contador_tiempo_reg_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock mt_hard_bd_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_1_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_1_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_1_1 and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware.

Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_mt_hard_bd_clk_wiz_0_0]

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mt_hard_bd_i/Circuito_para_pruebas_v1_0_0/U0/Logica_usuario/desbordamiento_signal_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mt_hard_bd_i/Circuito_para_pruebas_v1_0_0/U0/Logica_usuario/desbordamiento_signal_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch mt_hard_bd_i/Circuito_para_pruebas_v1_0_0/U0/Logica_usuario/en_contador_tiempo_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin mt_hard_bd_i/Circuito_para_pruebas_v1_0_0/U0/Logica_usuario/en_contador_tiempo_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock mt_hard_bd_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin mt_hard_bd_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
